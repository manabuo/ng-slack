# ng-slack
a slack version with angular an firebase

There's already a good course, 'Learn to build a Real-Time Slack clone with AngularFire' but it lacks some important
aspects.

What I'm doing with this version is that it uses webpack as a bundler, component-based architecture, testing, ES6.

I'm not taking credit, I just wanna put everything in order.

hope you like it ;)
